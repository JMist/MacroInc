You asked about measurements that include quality of life, and in those we try to measure the happiness of a country to determine its economic well-being.

Isn't it tough to measure happiness though? There's no happiness number or anything, unlike the value of goods.

/t Guru:
It is hard to measure happiness, but indices of measuring well-being look at similar qualities.

Things like the UN's Human Development Index, the HDI, look at the health, education, and standard of living of the people in a country.

All of these things are what produce a happy population, so we can mostly determine how happy a country's people are.

Wow, there are a lot of measures about the economy of a country! How do we know which is the best?

/t Guru:
Yup, and if we wanted to know how efficient the country was being, that is producing the most with the fewest resources, what could we look at?

/t Joe:
The GDP per capita! Because that factors in the amount of labor a country has.

/t Guru:
Exactly, and to know how well-off a country is, and whether it's a good idea to move there?

/t Joe:
Obviously the HDI, as it looks at the health, education, and quality of life in a country.
