Guru: Alright Joe. In the last lesson, you experienced scarcity. Our economy just doesn't have enough resources for our "unlimited wants".
/e
/t
So we need some way to determine where to put our scarce resources, and how much those resources are worth to you and I!

/t
Our economy's desire, or "Demand", for a resource or product is determined by a few factors.
/e
/t
First, if the price is high, I'll generally buy less of the product. If the price is low, I'll generally buy more of the product.
/e
/t
This occurs for one main reason. Imagine the following scenario.
/e
/t
You're back in our pizza car from our last project. Both back wheels pop off under the weight of the pizza.
/e
/t
On the side of the road, you see a man selling tires for $300 each. If you can afford it, maybe you buy two to replace the popped ones.
/e
/t
However, would a third tire be worth paying $300 for? Probably not. 
/e
/t
But if the price was $100 per tire, perhaps you'd buy three tires, just in case another pops.
/e
/t
This illustrates the powerful Economic concept of Diminishing Marginal Utility:
/e
/t
Each tire after the second is worth substantially less than the last.
/e
/t
Other things will affect your demand for the product, such as your income, your tastes, or the price of some reasonable substitute for the product.

Guru: That's a lot to remember! If you ever need to review this, just head back to the Wall of Wisdom.

So, now that you're informed about consumer demand, let's head into the field. Today, you'll be selling lemonade by the local "Lemon-8" track.
/e
/t
I'm sure we'll find some "teachable moments" along the way.
/e
/t
Let's get your lemonade recipe hammered out, then we'll hit the field. I'll swing out in the Pizza car for the ingredients each hour. You handle sales. Let's go!
