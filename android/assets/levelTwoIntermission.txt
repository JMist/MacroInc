Guru: For the last three hours, you competed with another seller for customers.
/e
/t
A true competitive market would look a little different from what you just experienced. 
/e
/t
Competitive markets contain hundreds of sellers, and thousands of buyers. Also, sellers are "price takers": the consumers, with their purchases, determine prices.
/e
/t
Also, all these sellers must be selling roughly the same product. You and your competitor are selling slightly different lemonade.
/e
/t
There is another, darker type of market.

The Command System.
/e
/t
All market, pricing, and production decisions are made by a central board.
/e
/t
This can work well in some instances; usually it leads to terrific failure.
/e
/t
Most times, one central board simply cannot process the wants and needs of an entire economy.
/e
/t
Anyway, for the next two hours, you'll be selling from within a Command System. I'll function as the central board. Good luck with your recipe!
