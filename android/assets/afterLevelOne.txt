That was pretty fun, but why did the car run out of gas?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
Ah, it's because there wasn't enough pizza to keep the car going!

/th Player:
(But why did we run out of pizza?)
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
I know what you're thinking, why did we run out of pizza?
/e
/t
Well, the reason for that is simple, but first let's get back to what an economy is.
/e
/t
It's getting the most, be it pizza, games, or phones, out of the resources at hand.
/e
/t
Resources are what goes into making different products. Economists use four different categories to define resources.
/e
/t
The first category is land. Land is all the natural things that go into a product, like the flour and cheese in pizza.
/e
/t
The next category is labor. This is whatever effort goes into making a product, like the chef that makes and cooks the pizza.
/e
/t
After labor comes capital. These are whatever products help to make another, like the pizza oven.
/e
/t
And last, but not least, is entrepreneurial ability.
/e

/t Player:
Entrepre-what?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
Yeah it's a mouthful. Anyway, entrepreneurial ability is the special labor that someone like Papa John does.
/e

/t
Papa John does a few very important things that are essential to producing a good.
/e
/t
He successfully combines the other resources, labor, capital, and land, that is, to produce the final product.
/e
/t
Papa John makes the main decisions, too, like whether to deliver, and comes up with new brilliant ideas, like the Fritos Chili Pizza.
/e
/t
Finally, Papa John takes all the risks of starting a new pizza business. His company might not be successful and he is the one who would lose money if it failed.

Ok, so why exactly did we run out of pizza? Is it because there weren't enough resources left to make more?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
Yes, you're exactly right. We have unlimited desires, so we want INFINITE PIZZA! 
/e
/t
However, the amount of resources we have are not infinite, so we can only make so much pizza. This concept is known as scarcity.
/e
/t
Scarcity is unlimited wants, but limited resources, got it?
/e
/f playerFace.png
/t Player:
Alright, I got it, but how can we actually measure how much we make?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
Do you remember the score at the top? It went up each time you collected a pizza.
/e
/f playerFace.png
/t Player:
Oh, I think I do remember that, it went up by 1 each time right?
/e 
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
That's correct. In the ride, each pizza had a value of 1.
/e
/t
We can measure the total output of an economy using what's known as the GDP.
/e
/t
GDP, or gross domestic product, is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a year.
/e
/t
This value is represented by a $ amount, but GDP isn't based on prices, it's based on the actual value of goods.
/e
/f playerFace.png
/t Player:
I think I understand. I know the price of gas is a lot cheaper here than it is back home.
/e
/t
But if I were to try to measure it, than I would be saying that back home we buy a lot more gas than we do here, just because it's more expensive.
/e
/t
But that's not really true, is it? The GDP is based on the amount and the value right?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
Essentially, yes. That's why we have to make sure that we account for differences in prices when calculating GDP.
/e
/t
Or our numbers become a little wacky.
/e
/f playerFace.png
/t Player:
But doesn't that give a pretty unfair advantage to really big countries, because they can make so much more?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
You're right that it does. There are other measures of the economic strength of a country, however.
/e
/t
GDP per capita is based on the population as well as the GDP, so it doesn't really favor big countries.
/e
/t
For example, Qatar has the highest GDP per capita, with only about 2 million people.
/e
/f playerFace.png
/t Player:
I've heard that Qatar doesn't treat some people very well though.
/e
/t 
Shouldn't we also think about the quality of life in a country?
/e
/f guruFace.png
/t Guru:
There are measures for that too, of course! Let's go on another ride!
